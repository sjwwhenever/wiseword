# WiseWord: Bridging the Gap in Vaccine Hesitancy Communication

## üïä Inspiration  
WiseWord was born out of the pressing need to address vaccine hesitancy in Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in vulnerable communities where existing health campaigns often miss the mark. Inspired by the significant role of religious leaders in these communities, we sought to empower them with tools to communicate reliable health information effectively.  

For example, in Zimbabwe, where 85% of the population identifies as Christian and 37% belong to Apostolic congregations, vaccine hesitancy remains a critical challenge.
